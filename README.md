# Satellite Image Classifier using Convolutional Neural Networks
Mapping the world around us has always been a human endeavor to advance economical output. A better
understanding of the places around us makes for more efficient traveling and exploitation of the land. However,
it has always been a very slow and tedious process to produce these maps, something technology has not
changed just yet. A new opportunity has arisen with the arrival of satellite imagery and an ever increasing
amount of computational power. An opportunity where this mapping can be done automatically so that this
tedious and slow job can be processed even more quickly and perhaps more accurately. It is with this in mind
we further analyze any possibilities.
